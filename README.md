# Data-Driven-Org-Final

research an organization or product that desires to become more “data driven”. 

Relying on the tools we discussed in class, you will identify a strategy to get there, using design methods to understand the problem and identify opportunities for a solution along with use cases. 

From there, you will develop a visualization and an executive presentation providing a perspective on “what could be” and a roadmap with recommendations to get there.  

Groups should work on a project based on a new data use case (in other words, not using the same data you might have used in previous assignments or projects) that has both descriptive and predictive analytics components (details below). You MAY use any strategy development you have worked on in prior group assignments (e.g., the strategy assignment or your previous design thinking assignment). 

PROPOSAL ONE: SPORTS!

College State University once had a storied football program but in recent years has failed to have any sort of success. You were just brought in as the new head coach to try and change that, field one of the greatest teams ever and restore the program to their glory days. You have two tasks, to field the most dominant team and do that while establishing a dynasty. To do this you will utilize data on the most dominant teams to take the field in recent memory and look at historical records of college football dynasties. Since college sports is based on recruiting, we will hope to use this data to identify the most important aspects of a player coming out of high school that can help produce a strong team.

The University of Alabama Crimson Tide football program is one of the most storied and legendary in the sport but going into the 2007 season, they hadn't been ranked as a top 25 team in six years. In stepped Nick Saban, the famed head coach to try and turn things around and he has succeeded in that, turning 'Bama into a dynasty. In the 15 years that he's been head coach they have been ranked as a top 25 team each season, winning six national championships, multiple other titles, and producing four Heisman trophy recipients as the best player in all of college football. This story makes them the perfect observation case for how to build a dynasty, which types of players to recruit to start building a legacy.

To analyze what makes the most dominant team on the field we will analyza data from some of the greatest teams in the modern era. These teams are the 2019 LSU Tigers, the 2001 Miami Hurricanes, the 2005 Texas Longhorns, the 2013 Florida State Seminoles, the 2018 Clemson Tigers, the 2004 USC Trojans, the 2014 Ohio State Buckeyes, and the 2008 Florida Gators. What's good about this list of teams is that they are all from different years and different areas of the countries so that we can see if there are some trends that emerge throughout all time and geography.

**ALTERNATE PROPOSAL: NYC TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS**

Big Idea: The NYC Traffic violations data aims to analyze the traffic rules violations trend and provide necessary recommendations to take preventive measures.

 Personas: NYC Police commissioner 

Story Points:
Analyze NYC traffic violations trends & frequency from 2018

Categorize violations by age group, Violations, and Violators’ State License 

Understand the Traffic tickets issued frequently by day wise and by which Police agencies and plan deputing police on frequent violation weekdays

Summarize the tickets violations reports and communicate to County management for operational needs for budget, forecast, and staffing needs

Share the violations reports by age group to the DMV office to plan preventive training materials 

Communicate the Top 5 violations report to the State transport department to further enforce plans to control the violations like ‘Warning for higher fine for speeding’, higher fines for uninsured & uninspected, etc.
