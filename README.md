# Data-Driven-Org-Final

research an organization or product that desires to become more “data driven”. 

Relying on the tools we discussed in class, you will identify a strategy to get there, using design methods to understand the problem and identify opportunities for a solution along with use cases. 

Create Personas and Journey Maps

From there, you will develop a visualization and an executive presentation providing a perspective on “what could be” and a roadmap with recommendations to get there.  

Groups should work on a project based on a new data use case (in other words, not using the same data you might have used in previous assignments or projects) that has both descriptive and predictive analytics components (details below). You MAY use any strategy development you have worked on in prior group assignments (e.g., the strategy assignment or your previous design thinking assignment).
